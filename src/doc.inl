	".Overview of zmac\n"
	"zmac is a Z-80 macro cross-assembler. It has all the features you'd\n"
	"expect. It assembles the specified input file (with a '.z' extension\n"
	"if there is no pre-existing extension and the file as given doesn't\n"
	"exist) and produces program output in many different formats@format.\n"
	"It also produces a nicely-formatted\n"
	"listing of the machine code and cycle counts alongside the source\n"
	"in a \".lst\" file.\n"
	"\n"
	"To reduce clutter and command line option usage, by default all zmac output is put\n"
	"into an (auto-created) _zout_ subdirectory.  For _file.z_ the listing\n"
	"will be in _zout/file.lst_, the TRS-80 executable format in _zout/file.cmd_\n"
	"and so on.  For more friendly usage in make files and integrated development\n"
	"environments the _-o_, _--oo_, _--xo_ and _--xd_ options may be used to select\n"
	"sepcific output file formats and where they are written.\n"
	"\n"
	"Undocumented@undoc Z-80 instructions are supported as well as 8080 code.\n"
	"\n"
	"zmac strives to be a powerful assembler with expressions familiar to C\n"
	"programmers while providing good backward compatibility with original\n"
	"assemblers such as Edtasm, MRAS and Macro-80.\n"

	"Labels can be up to 40 chars long.  They can start with and contain \n"
	"letters, digits, _$_, _._, _?_, _@_ and __.  Ambiguous identifiers like\n"

	" _####b2_\n"
	"  \n"
	" _####..._\n"
	"  \n"
	" _####endm_\n"
	"\n"
	"The macro is called by writing:\n"
	"|_m v1, v2, ..., vn_\n"
	"\n"
	"A macro call expands to the text of the macro's body, with each \n"
	"occurrence of a formal parameter _pk_ replaced by the corresponding \n"
	"value _vk_, and with each local symbol _?sk_ replaced by a new, unique \n"
	"symbol invented for this call.  Invented symbols begin with _?_,\n"
	"so you should avoid using such symbols elsewhere in your program.\n"
	"\n"
	"zmac currently does not check that you have provided the right number \n"
	"of parameters when calling a macro.  If you provide too few, unmatched \n"
	"formals are replaced with the empty string.  If you provide too \n"
	"many, the additional values begin to replace local symbols as if \n"
	"they were ordinary parameters.  (This could be considered a feature.)  \n"
	"After the local symbols are all replaced, additional parameters \n"
	"are silently ignored.\n"
	"\n"
	"For compatibility with Macro-80, the first line of a macro definition can\n"
	"list other labels that will be treated locally:\n"
	"\n"
	"|_####local lab1,lab2,..._\n"
	"\n"
	"Each time the macro is expanded the local labels are replaced with unique\n"
	"names thus avoiding multiple definition problems.\n"
	"\n"
	"For compatability with MRAS, macro arguments may be preceeded by _#_\n"
	"in their definition and use.\n"
	"\n"
	"Any _`_ (backquote) in a macro is ignored thus allowing a macro to\n"
	"construct identifiers.  For example:\n"
	"\n"
	" _move macro dir_\n"
	"  \n"
	" _######ld`dir`r_\n"
	"  \n"
	" _######endm_\n"
	"\n"
	"Invoking _move i_ will construct a _ldir_ block move instruction.\n"
	"\n"
	"For compatibility, _&_ can also be used as in MAC to concatenate\n"
	"macro parameters.  This conflicts with zmac's bitwise and operator but\n"
	"you can use the _and_ synonym in macros to avoid the conflict.\n"
	"\n"
	"In _--mras_ mode arguments will be expanded even if they are inside other\n"
	"identifiers.  The _move_ could be written:\n"
	"\n"
	" _move macro dir_\n"

	"Macro definitions can contain macro definitions which will be defined\n"
	"when the outer macro is first exapnded.  Macros can be redefined as\n"
	"well.\n"
	"\n"
	"Macro expansion continues to the _endm_ directive but can be stopped\n"
	"prematurely by the _exitm_ directive.  Typically the _exitm_ is inside\n"
	"some conditional part of the macro.\n"
	"\n"
	"Parameters passed to a macro can be empty and are tested with the _nul_\n"
	"operator:\n"
	"\n"
	" _if nul &par_\n"
	"  \n"
	" _..._\n"
	"  \n"
	" _endif_\n"
	"\n"
	"Macro parameters can contain commas if grouped inside _<_ and _>_.\n"
	"Or a comma can be escaped with _^_ which can also escape spaces and other\n"
	"special characters.  It is also be put in front of a macro parameter\n"
	"name inside the expansion to suppress the replacement by its value.\n"
	"\n"
	"Expansion of parameters in a macro body is purely textual.  This can\n"
	"lead to surprises in complex situations.  The _%_ character can be used\n"
	"to force a macro parameter to be replaced with the evaluation of it\n"
	"as an expression.\n"
	"\n"
	"\n"
	"..Inline Macros\n"
	"\n"
	"zmac supports the commonly available _rept_, _irp_ and _irpc_ inline macros\n"
	"\n"
	"_rept_ repeats its block the given number of times.  This will output 10\n"

	" _rept 10_\n"
	"  \n"
	" _######nop_\n"
	"  \n"
	" _endm_\n"
	"\n"
	"_irpc_ runs through a string of letters assigned them to a variable and\n"
	"expanding the macro block each time.  For example, this will load 7 into\n"
	"registers _b_, _d_ and _h_:\n"
	"\n"
	" _irpc reg,bdh_\n"
	"  \n"
	" _######ld &reg,7_\n"
	"  \n"
	" _endm_\n"
	"\n"
	"_irp_ runs through a list of parameters assiging each entry to a variable\n"
	"and expanding the macro block.  Here we load _bc_, _de_ and _hl_ with 0:\n"
	"\n"
	" _irp rpair,<bc,de,hl>_\n"
	"  \n"
	" _######ld &rpair,0_\n"
	"  \n"

	".Compatibility\n"
	"\n"
	"zmac is broadly compatible with many original Z-80 and 8080 assemblers\n"
	"because it accepts many different names for common operations and has\n"
	"liberal identifier and numeric formats.  It also accepts most simple\n"
	"usage of macros.\n"
	"\n"
	"When assembling old code keep these portability problems in mind.\n"
	"\n"
	"Expression order of evaluation may be different.  zmac uses C semantics\n"
	"more order of evaluation but assemblers often used simple left to right\n"
	"ordering.  zmac will evaluate _2+2*3_ as _8_ where other assemblers will\n"
	"yield _12_.  However, in _--mras_ mode expressions are evaluated strictly\n"
	"left-to-right for compatibility.\n"
	"\n"
	"zmac has no support operating on strings in macros.  Assemblers like Macro-80\n"
	"could perform conditional tests on strings.\n"
	"\n"
	"Advanced macros are unlikely to work.  zmac hasn't advanced to the state where\n"
	"all the possible ways of substituting parameters are supported.\n"
	"\n"
	"Consult the original assembler manual.  zmac error messages won't help you\n"
	"figure out what an unknown assembler command is supposed to do.\n"
	"\n"
	"Compare against original output.  The very safest thing to do when porting\n"
	"assembly code is to compare the binary output of zmac against that produced\n"
	"by the original assembler.  This way you can ensure everything has been\n"
	"interpreted correctly.  Only once that has been achieved should you modify\n"
	"the code.\n"
	"---\n"
	".Errors and Warnings\n"
	"\n"
	"Any errors or warnings encountered during assembly are reported to standard\n"
	"error and in the listing file.  The errors output immediately give the source\n"
	"file and line number containing the error.  In listings the error letter\n"
	"and message appear just after the line containing the error.\n"
	"\n"
	" B\n"
	"  Balance error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  A string is missing an closing quote or an _if_ is missing an _endif_\n"
	" E\n"
	"  Expression error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  An expression did not parse or attempts a divide or modulus by 0.\n"
	" F\n"
	"  Syntax error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  General problem with the syntax on a line.  Sometimes extra explanation\n"
	"  will be printed on standard output.\n"
	" I\n"
	"  Digit error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  A numeric constant has too many digits to be represented as a 32 bit number.\n"
	" M\n"
	"  Mult. def. error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  A symbol has been defined more than once and those values differ.\n"
	" P\n"
	"  Phase error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  On the second or subsequent assembly passes the assembly has changed\n"
	"  significantly.  Most commonly it means an _if_ has changed conditions\n"
	"  but can also happen when labels or equated values do not converge to\n"
	"  a fixed value.\n"
	" U\n"
	"  Undeclared error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  An undeclared symbol was used in an expression or _public_ statement.\n"
	" V\n"
	"  Value error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  An invalid value was given to a statement.  Often this means using less\n"
	"  than -128 or greater then 255 in a _defb_ or less than -32768 or greater\n"
	"  than 65535 in a _defw_.  Or similar invalid values used Z-80/8080 opcodes\n"
	"  requiring an 8 or 16 bit value (and other restrictions like 0 to 7 for _BIT_).\n"
	"  Also if a relative jump is out of range or if a negative value is given\n"
	"  in _defs_ or _dc_.\n"
	" O\n"
	"  Phase/Dephase error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  _phase_ was used within another _phase_ or _dephase_ without _phase_.\n"
	"  Or if _org_ is used within _phase_.\n"
	" A\n"
	"  Assertion failure error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  An assert statement evaluated to zero.\n"
	" J\n"
	"  Use JR error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  An absolute jump instruction was used where relative jump was in range\n"
	"  of the destination address.  Only generated if _-j_ or _jrpromote_ is\n"
	"  in effect.\n"
	" R\n"
	"  Not relocatable error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  An expression was used that must be generated at link time but cannot\n"
	"  be handled by the \".rel\" format.  For instance, an _org_ to a symbol in\n"
	"  the data segment when in the code segment.  Or a relative jump to a\n"
	"  different segment.  The \".rel\" format can evaluate expressions at link\n"
	"  time using the _high_, _low_, _not_, _-_, _+_, _*_, _/_ and _%_ operators.\n"
	"  zmac is clever enough to use _high_ or _low_ in place of _& $ff00_ and\n"
	"  _& 255_.  But it won't replace a _shl_ with a multiply.\n"
	" G\n"
	"  Register usage error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  A invalid register was given to an instruction.  For example, _LD B,(DE)_\n"
	"  or _ADD HL,IX_.\n"
	" Z\n"
	"  Z-80 instruction in 8080 mode error\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  An instruction was assembled that is only valid on the Z-80 but _.8080_\n"
	"  (or _-8_) mode is in effect.  However, use use of Z-80 mnemonics that\n"
	"  output valid 8080 instructions is always OK.\n"
	" H\n"
	"  $hex constant interpreted as symbol warning\n"
	" ##\n"
	"  A symbol such as _$FCB_ has been defined even though it could appear to\n"
	"  be a hexadecimal constant.  zmac will treat _$FCB_ as symbol for the entire\n"
	"  assembly which could be rather surprising if that were not the intent.\n"
	" N\n"
	"  Not implemented warning\n"
	" ##\n"
